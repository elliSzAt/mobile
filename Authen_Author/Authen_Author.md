### Authentication

Simply, ``authentication`` is the process of proving some information is true.

``Authentication`` is a process of proving a user's identity by providing their ``credentials`` which explains who you are to the system.

This is how ``authentication`` works.

### Authorization

``Authorization`` is the process of giving someone access to a system or information.

``Authorization`` is a security mechanism to determine access levels or user privileges related to system resources like files,  data, and application features. This is the process of granting or denying access to a network resource that allows the user access to various resources based on the userâ€™s identity.

### Authentication and Authorization together

``Authentication`` is an important part of an application and with ``authorization``, we have more control over the users using the application. When users register in the application, they are informing the server that they are new members. The next time users provide the information (``credentials``), which provided is verified by the server and if the information is valid (``authentication``), they are allowed to enter the application. After entering the appli cation, the server can have control of what resources are accessible by the users, which handled by ``authorization``.
